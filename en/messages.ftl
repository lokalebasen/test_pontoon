By default "My leases" is active which means that you are only shown information about those leases where you are stated as primary or secondary contact. If "All leases" are chosen you will be shown all leases for the provider which whom you are affiliated.

 ## Clients
 A client can have four different statuses:

 - *Active* means that you are in dialogue and working on completing a lease.

 - *Confirmed agreement* means that the client has signed a lease agreement.

 - *No interest* means that the client is not interested in your lease or you are not interested in letting to the client.

 - *Already known* means that you were already in dialogue with the client before you received the enquiry from %{site_name}


 ## Notes

 If you want to write a note to a client or a lease, this can be done by clicking on the client or the lease, writing the note in the note field and clicking "Save Note". The note will consequently be shown on the client or the lease until it is edited or deleted.
