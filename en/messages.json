The similarity between the vacancy the client has ordered information for and your vacancy is determined from a formula that takes into account size, price and location. If this similarity is over 75 % you will automatically receive information about the client, as we will send your contact details to the client. \n\nThe limit of 75 % is set based on a philosophy, that we do not want to compromise with the quality of leads we send, and if you the landlord have a vacancy that matches another vacancy on  %{site_name} by 75 % or more relative to the above mentioned criteria, then these to vacancies are close to identical. In these instances we believe it is obvious, that you get the opportunity to contact the client. It also means, that if none of your vacancies on %{site_name} are similar to other vacancies to a sufficient degree, you will not receive any extra client leads. Additionally, maximum **2 extra leases** can be associated to the clients order and it will be those with the best match.\n\nWe will of course clearly draw attention to when the case is \"Extra client lead\". Do you not want to receive \"Extra client leads\", you can unsubscribe by contacting us on tel. %{phone_number} or send a mail to [%{email}](mailto:%{email})\n\nDelivery of Extra client leads came into foce Tuesday 31st January 2012.\n\nWith the wish of a continued strong cooperation.
